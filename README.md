# forerun
A Haskell workflow booster for build dependencies in cabal projects.

# Are you tired of needing to look up the latest version number for a haskell hackage package, before needing to manually plug it into your cabal project file.

# Every

# Single

# Time?

# Well...

# That's what Forerun is for!


## Steps

- Run the script
- type in the name of the package (must be available on hackage.haskell.org)
- verify your cabal file's "build-depends" section to see if everything worked properly.
- Happy coding!
